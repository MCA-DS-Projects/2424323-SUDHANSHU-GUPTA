    "question": "What are your greatest strengths?",
    "question_category": "General",
    "question_difficulty": "Easy",
    "transcript": "My Greatest strength is I am a hardworking man and I am a good team did and I can work in very sometime 1 months",
    "feedback": "SCORE: 25\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n-   **Directness in Answering:** Sudhanshu, you directly addressed the question by starting with \"My Greatest strength is...\" This shows you understood the prompt and clearly intended to provide an answer.\n-   **Identification of Valued Traits:** You identified \"hardworking\" and \"team\" (implying teamwork) as strengths. These are generally positive qualities that employers look for in candidates.\n\nIMPROVEMENTS:\n-   **Grammar and Clarity:** The phrases \"I am a good team did\" and \"I can work in very sometime 1 months\" contain significant grammatical errors and are very unclear. \"Team did\" should likely be \"team player,\" and the final phrase is difficult to understand and reduces the professionalism of your answer.\n-   **Lack of Specific Examples and Elaboration:** While stating \"hardworking\" is a start, it lacks impact without an example. An interviewer needs to hear *how* you are hardworking or *what makes you* a good team member, rather than just a general statement.\n-   **Professional Language and Structure:** The overall response lacks the polished, professional tone expected in an interview setting. Each strength is a simple statement without supporting details, which limits its persuasiveness and makes it less memorable.\n\nSUGGESTIONS:\n-   **Use the STAR Method for Each Strength:** For each strength you mention (e.g., hardworking, team player), prepare a specific example using the STAR method: describe a **S**ituation, the **T**ask you had, the **A**ction you took, and the **R**esult of your actions. This will add depth and credibility to your claims.\n-   **Practice Articulation and Grammar:** Regularly practice articulating your answers out loud, paying close attention to grammar and word choice. Consider recording yourself to identify areas for improvement in clarity and professional phrasing, especially for common phrases like \"team player.\"\n-   **Quantify Your Strengths Where Possible:** Instead of just saying \"hardworking,\" think about how your hard work led to a specific, measurable achievement (e.g., \"I consistently worked extra hours to ensure a project was completed ahead of schedule, resulting in a 15% increase in efficiency for our team\").\n\nOVERALL FEEDBACK:\nSudhanshu, you made a direct attempt to answer the question and identified some key positive traits. However, to significantly improve this response, focus on refining your grammar, providing concrete examples to illustrate your strengths, and ensuring your language is clear and professional. Elevating the clarity and impact of your communication will make a much stronger impression in future interviews.",
